| **Characters** | 15-20? | Not fully documented |
| **Weapons** | 23 | 15 free, 8 premium |
| **Items** | Not specified | Auto-active inventory |

| **Achievements** | 120+ | 4 tiers |

**Total Entities:** ~200-250 (estimated)

---

### Content Gap Analysis

**Where Brotato Dominates:**
- 🔴 **Characters:** 62 vs. our 15-20 (3x more)
- 🔴 **Weapons:** 83 vs. our 23 (3.6x more)
- 🔴 **Items:** 177 vs. our ??? (unknown)

**Where We Differentiate:**
- 🟢 **Perks:** 50+ vs. Brotato's 0
- 🟢 **Minions:** 6 types vs. Brotato's 0 (they have turrets, not minions)
- 🟢 **Live Ops:** Goals, Events vs. Brotato's 0
- 🟢 **Social:** Trading Cards, Referrals vs. Brotato's 0

**Critical Question:**
- Is 23 weapons enough vs. Brotato's 83?
- Should we plan for 50+ weapons at launch?
- Or is our Perks/Minions differentiation enough?

**My Opinion:**
- Brotato's content volume is **insane** for a $4.99 game
- We can't match it at launch (solo dev)
- BUT our Perks + Minions + Live Ops = **enough differentiation**
- **Recommendation:** Launch with 30-40 weapons (not 23), add more post-launch

**Impact:** Increases build variety, synergy strategies

---

### Lesson 5: Add Item Tags to Characters ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Conclusion:** More content = more replayability.

**Recommendation:**

- **Phase 3 (12 months):** 50+ characters, 80+ weapons, 150+ items

---

### Lesson 7: Instant Retry > Death Penalties ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Evidence:**
