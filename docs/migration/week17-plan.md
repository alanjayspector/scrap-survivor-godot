# Week 17 - Expert Panel Design Session
## Barracks, Character Create, Character Details Overhaul

**Status:** PLANNING COMPLETE - READY TO IMPLEMENT
**Date:** 2025-11-27
**Estimated Effort:** 15-19 hours
**Focus:** Core character management experience polish

---

## 🎯 SESSION OBJECTIVE

Transform three critical screens from "MVP functional" to "emotionally compelling, production-quality" UI that makes players proud of their survivors and excited to create new ones.

### Screens in Scope

| Screen | Current State | Target State |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Barracks (Roster)** | 2-column grid, Option C background, functional | Trophy case that makes players proud |
| **Character Creation** | Basic name + type dropdown, MVP | Card-based type selection, immersive |
| **Character Details** | Awful, doesn't match visual identity | Hero showcase, consistent with Art Bible |

### Design Principle (Established Week 16)

> **"Marvel Snap Law"** - Characters are the stars, UI serves them.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ EXPERT PANEL

| Role | Focus Area |

## 📊 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Screen 1: Barracks (Character Roster)

**File:** `scenes/ui/barracks.tscn`

**Current Implementation:**
- 2-column GridContainer with CharacterCard components
- Option C dark gradient background (`barracks_interior.jpg`)
- Semi-transparent charcoal scroll background
- "Your Survivors" title with slot counter
- "Create New Survivor" and "Back to Hub" buttons

**Expert Panel Assessment:**

| Aspect | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Visual Identity | 7/10 | Option C background good, cards need polish |
| Mobile UX | 8/10 | 2-column grid appropriate, touch targets good |
| Emotional Impact | 5/10 | Functional but not "proud of my collection" |
| Performance | 9/10 | Works well with current character counts |

**Issues Identified:**
1. CharacterCard uses ColorRect for portrait (not visually compelling)
2. No selection glow/animation (selection feels flat)
3. Card entrance has no animation (feels static)
4. No visual distinction for "selected" character at a glance

---

### Screen 2: Character Creation

**File:** `scenes/ui/character_creation.tscn`

**Current Implementation:**
- Name input (LineEdit) with basic styling
- GridContainer with 4 type cards (text-based buttons)
- "Create & Play" and "Create & Hub" buttons
- Slot usage banner for FREE tier

**Expert Panel Assessment:**

| Aspect | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Visual Identity | 4/10 | Generic UI, doesn't feel "junkpunk" |
| Mobile UX | 5/10 | Keyboard issues (takes too much space, not dismissable) |
| Emotional Impact | 3/10 | Character creation should feel exciting |
| Type Selection | 4/10 | Text-heavy, no visual preview of types |

**Issues Identified:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Keyboard takes excessive real estate, not dismissable
2. Type cards are text-only (no visual preview)
3. No detailed view when tapping a type card
4. Background is plain (not Art Bible themed)
5. No "glow" selection effect on type cards
6. Feels like a form, not a "recruitment ceremony"

---

### Screen 3: Character Details

**File:** `scenes/ui/character_details_screen.tscn` + `character_details_panel.tscn`

**Current Implementation:**
- ColorRect background (solid color)
- Left sidebar with character list
- TabContainer with Stats/Gear/Records tabs
- Bottom action bar (Select/Start Run/Delete)
- Text-based stats display with icons as `[HP]`, `[DMG]` text

**Expert Panel Assessment:**

| Aspect | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Visual Identity | 3/10 | **AWFUL** - doesn't match Art Bible at all |
| Mobile UX | 6/10 | Sidebar works but feels cramped |
| Emotional Impact | 2/10 | No "hero showcase" moment |
| Information Architecture | 6/10 | Stats organized but not visually appealing |

**Issues Identified:**
1. **CRITICAL:** No hero portrait section (character should be prominently displayed)
2. ColorRect background (should use Art Bible texture)
3. Stats use text placeholders `[HP]` instead of icons
4. No visual type indicator (type color/badge)
5. Layout feels like a database admin panel, not a character showcase
6. Inconsistent with Barracks visual language

---

## 🎨 EXPERT PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Recommendation 1: Unified Card Component Architecture

**Sr Godot Developer & Sr UI/UX Designer:**

> "Both Barracks and Character Create should use the SAME card component with different data. This ensures visual consistency and reduces maintenance."

**Proposed: `CharacterTypeCard` Component**

```
scenes/ui/components/character_type_card.tscn
├── Button (root, 180×240pt)
├── PanelBg (with glow effect capability)
├── ContentContainer
│   ├── PortraitRect (type silhouette or player portrait)
│   ├── NameLabel (type name or character name)
│   ├── SubLabel (type stats preview or character level)
│   └── BadgeContainer (lock icon or selection badge)
└── GlowOverlay (for selection effect)
```

**Usage:**
- **Barracks:** `CharacterTypeCard.setup_player(character_data)` → Shows player portrait, name, level
- **Character Create:** `CharacterTypeCard.setup_type(type_id)` → Shows type silhouette, name, stat preview
- **Character Details (sidebar):** Smaller variant of same component

---

### Recommendation 2: Character Type Card Design

**Sr Mobile Game Designer:**

> "Character type selection is the first major decision a player makes. It should feel weighty and exciting, not like filling out a form."

**Type Card Visual Specification:**

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Card Size | 170×220pt (fits 2-column grid with margins) |
| Portrait Area | 140×140pt, type-colored silhouette |
| Type Name | 20pt bold, centered |
| Stat Preview | 14pt, "+20 HP, +3 Armor" format |
| Border | 2pt type color, 4pt glow when selected |
| Lock Overlay | 50% dim + lock icon for tier-restricted types |

**Type Silhouettes:**

| Type | Silhouette Description | Color |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| Scavenger | Figure with backpack, hunched posture | Gray (#999999) |
| Tank | Bulky figure with heavy armor | Olive (#4D7A4D) |
| Commando | Lean figure with rifle | Red (#CC3333) |
| Mutant | Figure with glowing aura, twisted pose | Purple (#8033B3) |

**Banana Nano Prompt for Type Silhouettes:**
```
Illustrated junkpunk style, character silhouette, 
[TYPE_DESCRIPTION], orange rim lighting on edges,
dark interior, hand-painted brushstroke style,
no background, transparent PNG, 512x512,
post-apocalyptic wasteland survivor aesthetic
```

---

### Recommendation 3: Character Details Hero Section

**Sr UI/UX Designer:**

> "The detail view needs a 'hero moment' - a large, prominent display of the character that makes the player feel proud. Think Marvel Snap card inspection or Darkest Dungeon character sheet."

**Hero Section Specification:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ← Back                    CHARACTER DETAILS │  Header (80pt height)
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                             │
│         ┌───────────────────┐               │
│         │                   │               │
│         │   [PORTRAIT]      │               │  Hero Section (200pt height)
│         │   200×200pt       │               │
│         │                   │               │
│         └───────────────────┘               │
│         CHARACTER NAME                       │  32pt bold, type color
│         Tank • Level 5                       │  20pt, type badge + level
│                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Stats │ Gear │ Records                     │  Tab Container
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  [Stats content with proper icons]          │
│                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Select]  [Start Run]  [🗑️]                │  Action Bar (80pt height)
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Background:**
- Use Art Bible texture (not solid ColorRect)
- Recommendation: `detailed-workshop.png` or new "character profile" background
- Dark gradient overlay for text readability

---

### Recommendation 4: Keyboard UX Fix

**Sr Mobile Game Designer & Sr Godot Developer:**

> "Keyboard UX is a critical mobile pattern. The current implementation violates iOS HIG."

**Current Problems:**
1. Keyboard takes too much vertical space
2. Can't dismiss keyboard by tapping outside
3. Content doesn't scroll up when keyboard appears

**Solution:**

```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
    # Make name input dismissable
    name_input.focus_exited.connect(_on_name_focus_lost)
    
    # Tap outside to dismiss
    var tap_catcher = Control.new()
    tap_catcher.set_anchors_preset(Control.PRESET_FULL_RECT)
    tap_catcher.mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_PASS
    tap_catcher.gui_input.connect(_on_background_tap)
    add_child(tap_catcher)
    move_child(tap_catcher, 0)  # Behind everything

func _on_background_tap(event: InputEvent) -> void:
    if event is InputEventMouseButton and event.pressed:
        name_input.release_focus()

func _notification(what: int) -> void:
    if what == NOTIFICATION_WM_SIZE_CHANGED:
        # Scroll content when keyboard appears
        _adjust_for_keyboard()
```

**Additional:**
- Use `virtual_keyboard_enabled` property
- Implement content scrolling when keyboard appears
- Add "Done" button on keyboard (iOS pattern)

---

### Recommendation 5: "Enter the Wasteland" Confirmation Screen

**Sr Product Manager & Sr Mobile Game Designer:**

> "The transition from Hub to combat is a critical moment. It should feel like you're about to embark on a dangerous journey, not just pressing 'Start'."

**Screen Flow:**
```
Hub → Tap Wasteland Gate → "Enter the Wasteland" Confirmation → Combat
```

**Screen Specification:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│         [WASTELAND GATE ART]                │  Full-bleed background
│         wasteland-gate.png                  │  (existing asset!)

│   │  └─────────────────────────┘        │   │
│   │                                     │   │
│   │  ⚠️ Danger Level: MODERATE          │   │  Optional difficulty indicator
│   │                                     │   │
│   │  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐ │   │

│   └─────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Copy:**
- **Title:** "ENTER THE WASTELAND"
- **Primary Action Button:** "GO" (simple, punchy - dramatic context provided by visuals)
- **Cancel Button:** "Cancel"

---

### Recommendation 6: New Art Asset Prompts

**Sr UI/UX Designer:**

**Asset 1: Character Creation Background**

Current state: Plain BackgroundPanel
Target: Immersive "recruitment center" feel

**Option A: Barracks Recruitment Interior (RECOMMENDED)**
```
Illustrated junkpunk style, interior barracks recruitment area,
military recruitment desk with forms and equipment,
"JOIN THE SURVIVORS" poster on corrugated metal wall,
dark atmospheric lighting with single overhead lamp,
hand-painted brushstroke style, muted earth tones,
post-apocalyptic military aesthetic, 2048x2048 square format,
dark vignette edges for UI overlay, space in center for cards
```

**Expert Panel Recommendation:** Option A (Barracks Recruitment Interior) - same visual family as roster screen, reinforces "recruiting a new survivor to your squad" metaphor.

Note: Cultivation Chamber is reserved for a separate Subscription tier feature (character cloning/duplication).

---

**Asset 2: Character Details Background**

Current state: ColorRect solid color
Target: "Character showcase" feel

```
Illustrated junkpunk style, interior workshop spotlight area,
single bright light source from above creating dramatic lighting,
industrial tools and workbench visible at edges (out of focus),
dark background with warm accent light, hand-painted brushstroke,
"character on display" atmosphere, 2048x2048 square format,
portrait orientation optimized, center area dark for content overlay
```

---

**Asset 3: Type Silhouettes (4 images)**

```
# Scavenger
Illustrated junkpunk style, character silhouette front view,
hunched figure with large backpack, goggles on forehead,
orange rim lighting on edges, dark interior fill,
hand-painted brushstroke, transparent background PNG,
512x512, post-apocalyptic survivor aesthetic

# Tank  
Illustrated junkpunk style, character silhouette front view,
bulky heavy-set figure with thick armor plating, helmet,
olive green rim lighting on edges, dark interior fill,
hand-painted brushstroke, transparent background PNG,
512x512, post-apocalyptic survivor aesthetic

# Commando
Illustrated junkpunk style, character silhouette front view,
lean athletic figure with rifle, tactical gear,
red rim lighting on edges, dark interior fill,
hand-painted brushstroke, transparent background PNG,
512x512, post-apocalyptic survivor aesthetic

# Mutant
Illustrated junkpunk style, character silhouette front view,

---

### Phase 6: Scrapyard Title Polish (30 min - 1 hour)
**Priority:** LOW (quick win)

**Problem:**
The "SCRAP SURVIVOR" title on the Scrapyard hub uses Window Yellow (`#FFC857`) which is meant for "lit windows, interior glow" per Art Bible. It looks out of place with our textures and colors.

**Current:**
```
font_color = Color(0.918, 0.773, 0.239, 1)  # Window Yellow
font_outline_color = Color(0, 0, 0, 1)      # Black outline
outline_size = 4
font_size = 48
```

**Solution Options:**

| Option | Color | Hex | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----|-----------|
| A: Rust Orange | `#B85C38` | Primary environment color, ties to metal/rust theme |
| B: Primary Orange | `#FF6600` | UI accent color, high visibility |
| C: Corrugated Tan | `#C4A77D` | Subtle, matches metal siding aesthetic |
| D: Premium Gold | `#FFD700` | Rich, premium feel |

**Expert Panel Recommendation:** 
- **Option B (Primary Orange `#FF6600`)** with **Burnt Umber (`#8B4513`) outline** 
- This creates high contrast, ties to UI accent palette, and feels "important"
- Add subtle drop shadow for depth

**Tasks:**
1. Update `scrapyard.tscn` GameTitle color to Primary Orange (`#FF6600`)
2. Change outline color to Burnt Umber (`#8B4513`)
3. Increase outline_size to 6 for better readability
4. Optional: Add drop shadow via Label shadow properties
5. Device QA

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Title feels integrated with Art Bible
- [ ] High readability on background
- [ ] Matches visual language of other screens
