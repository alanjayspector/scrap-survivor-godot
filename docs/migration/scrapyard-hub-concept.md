# Scrapyard Hub: Art & Interaction Concept

## 1. Core Concept: The Narrative Hub

The goal is to transform the main menu from a simple list of buttons into an immersive, narrative hub called **The Scrapyard**. This screen is not a UI overlay; it is a **place**—the player's home base.

The concept is an interactive diorama of a survivor's workshop or bunker. The player is safe inside, surrounded by their tools and scavenged equipment. The "UI" is integrated directly into this environment, with different "services" (like the Shop or Workshop) represented by physical, interactive stations. This approach connects game features directly to the world's story, making the hub an engaging part of the game loop rather than a simple menu.

## 2. Overall Atmosphere & Art Direction

*   **Theme:** "The Survivor's Workshop." A cozy, resourceful pocket of safety in a harsh, post-apocalyptic world.
*   **Perspective:** A fixed, cross-section view of a fortified room (e.g., a garage, bunker, or shipping container).
*   **Lighting:** A single, bare incandescent bulb hangs from the ceiling, casting a warm, yellow pool of light over the central area. The corners of the room are dark and shadowy. This focused light is key to creating the "sanctuary" feeling.
*   **Background:** The walls are made of patched-together materials like corrugated iron, cracked concrete, and rusted steel plates. Exposed pipes and conduits run along the ceiling.

## 3. Interactive Stations

The following table maps the game's services (as defined in `GAME-DESIGN.md`) to their physical representation within The Scrapyard hub.

| Service (from GDD) | Interactive Station | Visual & Narrative Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Combat** | **The Blast Door** | A massive, reinforced steel door on the right side of the scene. A large, hazard-striped lever or a glowing red button beside it serves as the "Start Run" interaction. This is the clear, imposing threshold between the safety of the hub and the danger of the wasteland. |
| **Workshop** | **The Workbench** | A cluttered workbench on the left, covered in tools, blueprints, spare parts, and a flickering CRT monitor. This is the heart of the survivor's ingenuity. Clicking it transitions to the dedicated Workshop screen for crafting and repairs. |
| **The Shop** (Free) | **The Quartermaster's Window** | A simple, sliding metal panel built into the back wall, reinforced with steel bars. A hand-painted sign says "TRADE." This feels like the official, reliable place to exchange scrap for basic supplies with the sanctuary's quartermaster. |
| **The Black Market** (Premium) | **The Shady Corner Door** | In a poorly-lit corner, a heavy, dented steel door is marked with a cryptic, scrawled symbol. A single red bulb flickers above it. This station feels illicit and exclusive, representing a connection to an underground network for rare goods. |
| **Atomic Vending** (Subscription) | **The Retro Vending Machine** | A surprisingly clean, pre-apocalypse vending machine with retro-futuristic branding. Its internal lights still hum with a faint atomic glow. It represents a rare, reliable source of daily goods from a bygone era, fitting the subscription model. |
| **Characters** | **A Locker / Filing Cabinet** | A row of battered metal lockers or a rusty filing cabinet against the wall. This feels like a place to manage personnel files or gear loadouts. Clicking it opens the Character Manager screen. |
| **Banking** | **A Small Safe** | A small, heavy-duty safe bolted to the floor near the workbench. It's clearly for stashing valuables. Clicking it opens a simple UI to view currency balances. |
| **Upgrade (IAP)** | **A Pristine Terminal** | In stark contrast to the surrounding grime, this is a clean, pre-war computer terminal. It hints at a connection to still-functioning satellite or network systems, providing access to powerful, account-level upgrades. |
| **Settings** | **A Wall-Mounted Gear** | A single, large mechanical gear is mounted on the wall, appearing to be part of a larger, unseen mechanism. This is an intuitive, non-intrusive symbol for accessing the game's settings menu. |

This document should serve as the foundational guide for the visual and interactive design of the main hub scene.
