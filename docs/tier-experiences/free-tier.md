## 1. Value Proposition: A Complete Game, Not a Demo

The Free Tier of Scrap Survivor is a complete, satisfying gameplay experience. Our philosophy is to earn player trust and loyalty by providing a full game loop without paywalls. Free players have access to all core mechanics and can play indefinitely without spending money.

**The core promise: We give you a great game for free. If you love it, you can support us and enhance your experience.**

## 2. The Player Journey

1.  **Onboarding:** The player starts the game, creates their account, and is introduced to the Scrapyard hub.
2.  **First Character:** The player chooses one of the 3 starter character types (e.g., Tank, DPS, Support) and creates their first Character Instance.
3.  **Core Loop:** The player enters The Wasteland for their first run, experiences the wave-based combat, collects Scrap, and returns to the Scrapyard.
4.  **Progression:** The player uses Scrap in the Shop to buy items, making their character stronger for the next run.
5.  **Engagement:** The player engages with core systems like Stats, Achievements, and basic Goals, providing a clear path for progression and mastery.

## 4. The Path to Premium: Community Growth

Instead of forcing players to watch ads, we reward them for sharing the game. The path to unlocking premium content for free is a core part of the Free Tier experience.

- **Referral System:** Every player has a unique code.
- **Earnable Rewards:** By referring friends, players can earn permanent rewards, including Scrap bonuses, a permanent revive ability, and ultimately, the full Premium Pack.

This model respects the player and fosters organic, community-driven growth.

## 5. Upgrade Incentive

As players invest time and want to explore deeper strategies, the limitations of the Free Tier will become apparent. They will see locked character types and hear about features like Perks and Minions from the community, creating a natural desire to upgrade.

The primary driver for a free player to upgrade is to **unlock more variety and strategic depth** in their gameplay experience.
