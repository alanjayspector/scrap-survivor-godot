## 5. Upgrade Incentive

The motivation to subscribe is driven by **convenience and optimization**.

- **For the Power Gamer:** Players who want to optimize multiple character builds will find Quantum Banking/Storage indispensable.
- **For the Risk-Averse Player:** Mr. Fix-It's passive repair is a huge value proposition, as it provides insurance against losing legendary items that have hundreds of hours of gameplay invested in them.
- **For the Busy Player:** The Idle Systems ensure that the player is always making progress, even when they don't have time for an active run.
