## 6. Upgrade Incentive

The primary motivation to upgrade to Premium is **variety and character options**.

- **From Free:** Players who enjoy the core loop but want to experiment with Tinkerer's build variety or Salvager's resource efficiency will see Premium as the natural next step.
- **For Subscription:** Premium is not a prerequisite for Subscription, but both tiers offer distinct value propositions.
