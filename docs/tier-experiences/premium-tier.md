## 4. Cost & Revenue Analysis

- **Price:** $4.99 (one-time IAP)
- **Net to Developer (Year 1):** Approximately **$3.05** after platform fees (30%) and payment processing.

This price point is competitive with other successful indie games on mobile (e.g., _Brotato_) and represents a significant value for the amount of content unlocked.

## 5. Upgrade Incentive

The primary motivation for a player to upgrade to Premium is **variety and depth**. While the free experience is a complete game, the Premium Tier is a vastly larger one.

- **From Free:** Players who enjoy the core loop but want to experiment with more character builds, item synergies, and gameplay systems will see the Premium Tier as a natural next step.
- **For Subscription:** The Premium Tier is a prerequisite for the Subscription Tier, making it a necessary step for players who want the ultimate convenience features.
