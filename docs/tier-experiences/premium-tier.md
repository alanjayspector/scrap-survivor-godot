## 5. Upgrade Incentive

The primary motivation for a player to upgrade to Premium is **variety and depth**. While the free experience is a complete game, the Premium Tier is a vastly larger one.

- **From Free:** Players who enjoy the core loop but want to experiment with more character builds, item synergies, and gameplay systems will see the Premium Tier as a natural next step.
- **For Subscription:** The Premium Tier is a prerequisite for the Subscription Tier, making it a necessary step for players who want the ultimate convenience features.
