# DLC Packs System

**Status:** Draft - Post-Launch Monetization
**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Purpose:** Paid content packs for additional characters, blueprints, and minion patterns

---

## Overview

DLC Packs are **optional paid content expansions** that add new gameplay options without fragmenting the player base. Each pack includes a themed collection of characters, weapon/item blueprints, and minion patterns.

**Key Philosophy:**
- ✅ **NOT pay-to-win** - DLC content is sidegrades, not upgrades
- ✅ **NOT required** - Base game is complete without DLC
- ✅ **Cosmetic variety + build diversity** - New playstyles, not raw power
- ✅ **Fair pricing** - $1.99-$4.99 per pack

**Brotato comparison:**
✅ Similar model - Brotato DLC "Abyssal Terrors" is $2.99
✅ Adds 15 characters, 21 enemies, 1 zone (content expansion, not P2W)

---

## DLC Pack Structure

### Standard DLC Pack Contents

**What each pack includes:**
1. **2-4 Characters** - New character types with unique mechanics
2. **5-10 Blueprints** - Weapon/item crafting recipes
3. **2-3 Minion Patterns** - Exclusive minion types (Subscription feature)
4. **Themed Content** - Cohesive theme (Energy Weapons, Medieval Knights, etc.)

**What DLC does NOT include:**
- ❌ Stat boosts (not P2W)
- ❌ Premium/Subscription tier upgrades (separate purchases)

## DLC Character Balance

### Design Principles

**DLC characters should:**
- ✅ Offer **new playstyles**, not stronger stats
- ✅ Have **unique mechanics** not in base game
- ✅ Be **balanced against base characters**
- ✅ Create **build synergies** with DLC blueprints

**Example: Technomancer (DLC character)**
```
Base Stats:
- Max HP: 100 (same as default)
- Damage: 0 (same as default)
- Engineering: +50 (unique focus)

Unique Mechanic:
- Energy weapons scale 100% with Engineering
- Minions gain +25% attack speed per 10 Engineering

Trade-off:
- Can't use non-energy weapons effectively
- Requires Engineering build (limits variety)

Result: Different playstyle, not stronger overall
```

---

### DLC vs Base Power Comparison

**Power Budget:**
```
Base Character (Bruiser):
  +20 Max HP, +15 Melee Damage
  Power Budget: ~35 stat points

DLC Character (Technomancer):
  +50 Engineering, +100% Energy weapon scaling
  Power Budget: ~35 stat points equivalent

Result: Equal power, different focus
```

---

## DLC Blueprint Balance

### Design Principles

**DLC blueprints should:**
- ✅ Offer **thematic variety**, not power creep
- ✅ Be **sidegrades** to base game blueprints
- ✅ Create **new build paths**, not mandatory upgrades
- ✅ Synergize with DLC characters (but work for all characters)

**Example: Plasma Rifle (DLC T4 Weapon)**
```
Stats:
- Damage: 50 (100% Elemental)
- Attack Speed: 1.5s cooldown
- Range: 500
- Special: Pierces 2 enemies, scales 100% with Engineering

Comparison to Base T4 Weapon (Laser Gun):
- Laser Gun: 40 damage (400% Ranged), 1.98s cooldown, pierces 1
- Plasma Rifle: 50 damage (100% Elemental), 1.5s cooldown, pierces 2

Trade-off:
- Plasma Rifle: Better for Engineering builds (Technomancer)
- Laser Gun: Better for Ranged builds (Ranger)

Result: Different builds, not strictly better
```

---

## Revenue Projections

### DLC Pack Sales Estimates

**Assumptions:**
- 100,000 Premium tier players
- 10% buy DLC packs (industry average for indie games)
- Average $2.99 per pack
- 3 DLC packs per year

**Year 1 DLC Revenue:**
```
Pack 1 (Month 3): 10,000 sales × $2.99 = $29,900
Pack 2 (Month 6): 10,000 sales × $2.99 = $29,900
Pack 3 (Month 12): 10,000 sales × $4.99 = $49,900

Total DLC revenue: $109,700
After platform fees (30%): $76,790
```

**DLC Revenue vs Base Game:**
```
Base Game Revenue (Year 1):
- Premium: $49,900
- Subscription: $10,764
- Total: $60,664

DLC Revenue (Year 1): $76,790

DLC potentially earns MORE than base game after Year 1!
```

**This justifies post-launch DLC development.**

**Post-launch:**

Subscription + All DLC Bundle: $12.99 (save $3)
  Instead of $2.99/month + $2.99 × 3 packs = $15.96
```

**Holiday Sales:**
- Black Friday: 50% off all DLC

## Open Questions

**For discussion:**
1. Should DLC packs ever go on sale (discounts), or stay fixed price?
   - **Recommendation:** Sales during holidays (50% off) to drive impulse purchases

2. Should DLC characters be available in Free tier preview mode (can't play, but can see)?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, creates FOMO for Free players

3. Should there be a "Season Pass" ($9.99 for all Year 1 DLC)?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, offer at launch (pre-order discount)

4. Should DLC blueprints be tradeable via Quantum Storage (Subscription)?
   - **Recommendation:** No, DLC blueprints are account-bound

---

## Summary

DLC Packs provide:
- ✅ Post-launch revenue stream ($70k+ Year 1)
- ✅ Content variety (new characters, builds, minions)
- ✅ Player retention (seasonal DLC releases)
- ✅ NOT pay-to-win (sidegrades, not upgrades)
- ✅ Fair pricing ($1.99-$4.99 per pack)

**DLC Strategy:**
- 3 packs per year (Months 3, 6, 12)
- $2.99 standard packs, $4.99 deluxe packs
- Instant blueprint unlocks (no grind)
- Premium tier required (Free must upgrade first)
- Themed content (Energy Weapons, Medieval Knights, etc.)

**This provides ongoing development funding while respecting player investment in base game.**
