# Next Session: Week 16 Mobile UI Standards Overhaul

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-22
**Current Branch**: `main`
**Current Phase**: Phase 4 Bug Fixing (Critical)
**Status**: Phase 0-3.5 complete, Phase 4 complete but BROKEN (buttons non-functional)

---

## Quick Start

If continuing this work, say: **"continue with Week 16 Phase 5"**

---

## Week 16 Progress

**Goal**: Transform desktop-style UI into mobile-native experience (iOS HIG compliant)

**Total Time**: 16.5 hours estimated → **~5.5 hours remaining** (6 hours saved!)

### Completed Phases ✅

#### Phase 0: Pre-Work & Baseline (0.5h) ✅
- Visual regression infrastructure ([scripts/debug/visual_regression.gd](scripts/debug/visual_regression.gd))
- Analytics autoload stub ([scripts/autoload/analytics.gd](scripts/autoload/analytics.gd))
- Baseline screenshots (tests/visual_regression/baseline/)
- Branch: Using `main` (feature/week16-mobile-ui was abandoned)

#### Phase 1: UI Component Audit (1.5h) ✅
- **Created**: UI audit tool ([scripts/debug/ui_audit.gd](scripts/debug/ui_audit.gd))
- **Created**: Mobile UI spec ([docs/ui-standards/mobile-ui-spec.md](docs/ui-standards/mobile-ui-spec.md))
- **Generated**: Full audit report ([docs/ui-audit-report.md](docs/ui-audit-report.md))
- **Generated**: Phase 1 summary ([docs/week16-phase1-summary.md](docs/week16-phase1-summary.md))

**Audit Results**:
- ✅ **ALL buttons iOS HIG compliant** (0 violations, 100% pass rate)
- ✅ **8 of 9 screens perfect** (0 critical issues)
- 🚨 **1 screen needs fix**: character_selection.tscn (15 labels at 12pt)

#### Phase 2: Typography Fixes (1h) ✅
- **Consulted**: Expert panel (Sr. PM + Sr. Mobile Game Designer)
- **Fixed**: Character selection card typography hierarchy
- **Changes**:
  - Stat labels: 12pt → **16pt** (Primary decision content - Label tier)
  - Description: 13pt → **15pt** (Flavor text - readable but de-emphasized)
  - Aura labels: 12pt → **14pt** (Secondary metadata - Caption tier)
  - Character name: 22pt (unchanged - already optimal)
  - Hint text: 14pt (unchanged - already optimal)

**Visual Hierarchy Achieved**: Name (22pt) > Stats (16pt) > Desc (15pt) > Aura (14pt)

**Expert Panel Verdict**:
- ✅ Industry-aligned with mobile roguelite standards (Brotato, Slay the Spire, Hearthstone)
- ✅ Space-safe: 85pt headroom remaining in 170×330 cards (LOW RISK)
- ✅ Accessibility-ready: 16pt × 1.3× scaling = 20.8pt (fits comfortably)
- ✅ Tests passing: 647/671
- **Confidence**: 90/100

**Commit**: `7b2e897` - feat(ui): improve character card typography hierarchy (Week 16 Phase 2)

#### Phase 3: Touch Targets (SKIPPED) ✅
- **Skipped implementation** - ALL buttons already meet standards!
- 0 buttons < 44pt (iOS minimum)
- 0 buttons < 60pt (recommended)
- Button range: 60-200pt (excellent)
- **Time saved**: 3 hours

#### Phase 3.5: Mid-Week Validation Checkpoint (0.45h) ✅ **COMPLETE!**
- **Validated**: Character selection typography on iPhone 15 Pro Max
- **Decision**: iPhone 12+ (iOS 15+) support matrix established
- **Result**: ✅ **PASS** - All success criteria met
- **GO/NO-GO**: **GO** - Proceed to Phase 4

**Key Decisions**:
1. **Device Support Matrix**: iPhone 12+ (iOS 15+)
   - Industry-standard 5-year device support
   - 88% market coverage
   - No iPhone 8 support (8-year-old device, only 2% market)
   - Expert consultation: [docs/expert-consultations/device-compatibility-matrix-consultation.md](docs/expert-consultations/device-compatibility-matrix-consultation.md)

2. **Validation Approach**: Single flagship device + safety margin analysis
   - iPhone 15 Pro Max (6.7") physical device: ✅ PASS
   - iPhone 12 mini (5.4") simulator: Skipped (low ROI, technical blocker)
   - Typography safety margin: 16pt stats = 23% above 13pt minimum
   - Risk level: LOW

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Character Selection: ✅ "I am good with the changes"
   - Character Roster: 📝 Noted for future visual polish session
   - Future work documented: [docs/future-work/character-roster-visual-overhaul.md](docs/future-work/character-roster-visual-overhaul.md)

**Documentation**:

- Validation guide: [docs/week16-phase3.5-validation-guide.md](docs/week16-phase3.5-validation-guide.md)
- Completion summary: [docs/week16-phase3.5-completion-summary.md](docs/week16-phase3.5-completion-summary.md)

#### Phase 4: Dialog & Modal Patterns (1.5h) ✅ **COMPLETE!**
- **Created**: MobileModal component ([scripts/ui/components/mobile_modal.gd](scripts/ui/components/mobile_modal.gd))
- **Created**: ModalFactory helper ([scripts/ui/components/modal_factory.gd](scripts/ui/components/modal_factory.gd))
- **Improved**: CharacterDetailsPanel now uses mobile-native bottom sheet
- **Implemented**: Progressive delete confirmation (two-tap pattern)
- **Added**: Backdrop overlay with tap-to-dismiss
- **Added**: Swipe-down gesture for sheets
- **Added**: Entrance/exit animations (300ms/250ms)
- **Fixed**: Invalid UID in mobile_modal.tscn (was breaking character roster buttons)

**Key Features**:
- 🎉 **Mobile-native dialogs** - ALERT, SHEET, and FULLSCREEN types
- 🎨 **Backdrop overlay** - Semi-transparent dimmed background
- ✨ **Smooth animations** - Fade + scale (alerts), slide up/down (sheets)
- 👆 **Gesture dismissal** - Tap outside, swipe down
- 🛡️ **Progressive delete** - Two-tap safety pattern prevents accidental deletions
- 📱 **iOS HIG compliant** - Proper sizing, spacing, animations

**Documentation**:
- Dialog audit report: [docs/week16-phase4-dialog-audit.md](docs/week16-phase4-dialog-audit.md)

- `e7e00fc` - docs: add GameLogger refactor backlog and update session handoff
- `c26f02f` - fix(utils): make GameLogger output to console in debug builds

**QA Status**:
- ❌ Manual QA failing on iPhone 15 Pro Max (buttons non-functional)
- Pass 1: Buttons broken
- Pass 2: Buttons still broken
- Pass 3: Added diagnostic logging → logs invisible
- Pass 4: Fixed GameLogger → ✅ COMMITTED, ready for rebuild

---

### 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: Character Roster Buttons Non-Functional (QA Pass 4/5)

**Problem**: After Week 16 Phase 4 implementation (MobileModal system), character roster buttons stopped working:
- ❌ Details button pressed → no response
- ❌ Delete button pressed → no response
- ✅ User reached roster successfully (navigated from Wasteland → Hub → Roster)

**QA Log**: [qa/logs/2025-11-22/4](qa/logs/2025-11-22/4)

**Investigation Status**:
1. ✅ Added diagnostic logging in commit `1f3943e` (button press, signal emission tracking)
2. ❌ Discovered diagnostic logs were INVISIBLE in QA output
3. ✅ Root cause: GameLogger writes to `user://logs/` file only, not console
4. ✅ Fix: Modified GameLogger to also print to console in debug builds (commit `c26f02f`)
5. ⏭️ **NEXT**: Rebuild app, run QA Pass 5 with visible logs, analyze signal chain

**GameLogger Architecture Issue** (3rd Occurrence):
- **Problem**: Monolithic `_write_log()` function tightly couples file I/O and console output
- **Root Cause**: No Handler/Appender pattern (industry standard)
- **Impact**: Each time we need new behavior → modify core function (technical debt)
- **Solution**: Proper handler-based architecture (2-4 hours)
- **Decision**: Use workaround now to unblock QA, refactor in Week 17
- **Backlog**: Added to [docs/migration/week17-tentative.md](docs/migration/week17-tentative.md) Priority 6

**Process Improvements Implemented** (Commit `9a4329e`):
- ✅ Empty commit detection (pre-commit hook)
- ✅ Fix claim validation (commit-msg hook)
- ✅ Pre-push full lint (new hook)
- ✅ gdformat/gdlint conflict resolution (enum comments above declaration)

**Commits Complete** (Ready for QA Pass 5):
- ✅ `c26f02f` - GameLogger workaround (console output in debug builds)
- ✅ `e7e00fc` - Documentation updates (Week 17 backlog + session handoff)
- Character roster/card diagnostic logging will now be visible in console

**User Feedback**: "tired of red herrings" - wants to fix actual button bug, not architecture discussions

---

### Current Phase: Phase 5 (Visual Feedback & Polish) - BLOCKED

**Status**: BLOCKED by Phase 4 button bug
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours (after bug fix)

#### Objectives

Redesign confirmation dialogs and modals for mobile-native experience:
1. **Larger, mobile-native dialogs** (not desktop-style small popups)
2. **Standardize modal presentation** (full-screen overlays)
3. **Improve CharacterDetailsPanel** sizing/spacing
4. **Add dismiss gestures** (swipe down, tap outside)
5. **Progressive delete confirmation** (prevent accidents)

#### Implementation Tasks

**Dialog System Overhaul**:
- [ ] Audit existing dialogs (ConfirmationDialog, CharacterDetailsPanel, etc.)
- [ ] Define mobile dialog standards (sizes, spacing, animations)
- [ ] Implement full-screen modal overlay system
- [ ] Add dismiss gestures (tap outside, swipe down)
- [ ] Improve CharacterDetailsPanel for mobile (larger, more spacious)

**Delete Confirmation Pattern**:
- [ ] Implement progressive confirmation (tap once = warning, tap again = delete)
- [ ] Or: Swipe-to-delete pattern (industry standard)
- [ ] Add visual feedback (color change, animation)
- [ ] Test accidental deletion prevention

**Modal Animations**:
- [ ] Entrance animations (fade + scale, or slide up)
- [ ] Exit animations (fade out, or slide down)
- [ ] Backdrop fade (dim background when modal opens)

#### Success Criteria

- ✅ All dialogs feel "mobile-native" (not cramped desktop popups)
- ✅ Tap-outside-to-dismiss works reliably
- ✅ CharacterDetailsPanel is spacious and easy to read
- ✅ Delete confirmations prevent accidental deletions
- ✅ Modal animations feel smooth and professional

### Upcoming Phases

#### Phase 5: Visual Feedback & Polish (2h)
- Loading indicators for scene transitions
- Improve color contrast (WCAG AA compliance)
- Accessibility settings (animations, haptics, sounds)
- Audio feedback coverage
- **Note**: Button animations & haptics already complete!

#### Phase 6: Spacing & Layout Optimization (1.5h)
- Apply mobile spacing scale (16-32pt margins)
- **ScreenContainer component** for safe area insets
- Test on iPhone 15 Pro Max (notch/Dynamic Island)
- Test on iPhone 12 mini (compact screen)
- Verify responsive scaling

#### Phase 7: Combat HUD Mobile Optimization (2h)
- Audit Combat HUD (XP bar, health, timer, wave counter)
- Ensure HUD respects safe areas
- Optimize font sizes for mobile readability
- Verify HUD doesn't occlude gameplay
- Add touch-friendly pause button
- Test during actual combat

**Session Date**: 2025-11-22
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-22 (Phase 4 complete but BROKEN, debugging button issue)

**Next Session Prompt**: "continue debugging Week 16 Phase 4 button issue"

**Immediate Next Steps** (QA Pass 5):
1. ✅ Commit GameLogger workaround fix (COMPLETE - commit c26f02f)
2. ⏭️ User rebuilds app with latest changes (includes diagnostic logging)
3. ⏭️ Run QA test: Launch → Wasteland → Hub → Roster → Press Details/Delete
4. ⏭️ Analyze console logs to find where button signal chain breaks
5. ⏭️ Fix actual button bug based on evidence
6. ⏭️ Complete Phase 4 QA validation
7. ⏭️ Resume Phase 5 (Visual Feedback & Polish)

**Expected Logs in Console** (QA Pass 5):
- `[CharacterRoster] Initializing`
- `[CharacterCard] Setup starting` (for each character card)
- `[CharacterCard] Details button pressed` ← When Details tapped
- `[CharacterCard] Details signal emitted` ← After button press
- `[CharacterRoster] ⭐ DETAILS SIGNAL RECEIVED ⭐` ← If signal reaches handler
- If any log missing → indicates where signal chain breaks

**Technical Debt Identified**:
- GameLogger needs handler-based architecture refactor (added to Week 17 backlog)
- This is the 3rd time "hack with prints" workaround has occurred
- Industry-standard pattern: Logger → Handlers (File, Console, Remote) → Formatters
