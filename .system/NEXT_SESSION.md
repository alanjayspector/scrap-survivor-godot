## Quick Start Prompt

```
I'm continuing Week 16 Phase 2: Typography System Overhaul.

Please start by reading these files in order:
1. .system/CLAUDE_RULES.md
2. docs/migration/week16-implementation-plan.md
3. docs/mobile-ui-specification.md

Once you've read all three, confirm you understand:
- Phase 0 is complete ✅ (baseline captured, analytics documented)
- Phase 1 is complete ✅ (UI audit done)
- Phase 2 is IN PROGRESS (Typography System - mobile font sizes)
- Success criteria: iOS HIG typography scale applied, Theme resource created, all text readable on iPhone 8

Then check with me on current Phase 2 status and what's been completed so far.

Context you'll need:
- Current branch: feature/week16-mobile-ui
- All tests passing: 611/635 ✅
- Mobile spec version: 1.1 (Expert Panel Validated)
- Phase 2 estimated effort: 2.5 hours
- Phase 2 key deliverables:
  - Godot Theme resource (mobile_theme.tres)
  - iOS HIG typography scale (17pt body min, 22pt headers)
  - Dynamic type scaling support
  - Readability testing on iPhone 8 simulator

Ready when you are!
```

## Important Decisions Made

**Phase 0:**
- Using landscape-only orientation (sensor-based)
- 12-14pt body text allowed (strategic deviation with 15.1:1 contrast)
- Pre-calculated contrast ratios for performance
- Safe area caching to reduce OS calls

**Phase 1:**
- (Update with any architectural decisions from Phase 1)

**Phase 2:**
