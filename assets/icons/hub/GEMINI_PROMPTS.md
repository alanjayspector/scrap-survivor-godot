## General Style Guidelines for All Icons

**DO:**
- Use bold, thick outlines (3-4px minimum stroke weight)
- Keep shapes simple and geometric
- Use high contrast between icon and background
- Add weathering details (rust, scratches) but not so much it obscures the shape
- Make icons instantly recognizable at thumbnail size
- Use wasteland color palette: RUST_ORANGE (#D4722B), SOOT_BLACK (#2B2B2B), DIRTY_WHITE (#E8E8D0)

**DON'T:**
- Create detailed, photorealistic illustrations
- Use gradients or complex shading
- Make lines too thin (under 2px)
- Add small details that disappear at 80x80px
- Use bright, clean colors (everything should look worn/weathered)
- Create abstract shapes - icons should be recognizable objects

**Test**: Show the icon to someone for 3 seconds. Can they guess what button it's for?
